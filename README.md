# FFX_Mix_Compendium
This is a companion app for Final Fantasy X Mix Overrive. It breaks down the mixing process into three tabs:

Mixer: Input two items to get an instant, filtered result.

Mix Result Index: Browse all 64 unique Overdrives and their full recipe combinations. Search results also take the Mix description into account.

Item Sources: Find exact steal/bribe/drop etc. info for any item.

Click any item or mix to jump to its info page. Hyperlinked between items and mix results.

Comes with three themes (Dark Default, FFX PS2 inspired, FFX HD inspired)
